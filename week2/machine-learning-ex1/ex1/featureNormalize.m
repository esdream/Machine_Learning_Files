function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

% You need to set these values correctly
X_norm = X;
mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: First, for each feature dimension, compute the mean
%               of the feature and subtract it from the dataset,
%               storing the mean value in mu. Next, compute the
%               standard deviation of each feature and divide
%               each feature by it's standard deviation, storing
%               the standard deviation in sigma.
%
%               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a
%               feature and each row is an example. You need
%               to perform the normalization separately for
%               each feature.
%
% Hint: You might find the 'mean' and 'std' functions useful.
%

for i = 1:size(X, 2)

    % get the value of each column
    x_norm_col = X(:, i);

    % calculate the mean of each column
    mu(i) = mean(x_norm_col);

    % calculate the standard error of each column
    sigma(i) = std(x_norm_col);

    % normalization
    X_norm(:, i) = (x_norm_col - mu(i)) / sigma(i);
